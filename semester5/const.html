<h2>Salient Features of the Indian Constitution</h2>
The Indian Constitution, adopted on November 26, 1949, and effective from January 26, 1950, is a comprehensive and dynamic document that outlines the framework for governance in India. Here are the key salient features that distinguish the Indian Constitution:

<h3>1. Written and Detailed Constitution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Comprehensive Document</strong>: The Indian Constitution is one of the lengthiest written constitutions in the world, containing 470 articles, 25 parts, and 12 schedules (as of now).</li> <li><strong>Exhaustive Coverage</strong>: It includes provisions not only for the structure of government but also for the rights of citizens, the powers and functions of various organs of government, and the relationship between the Union and the States.</li> </ul> <h3>2. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Amendment Process</strong>: The Constitution provides a balance between rigidity and flexibility. Some provisions can be amended by a simple majority in Parliament, while others require a special majority, and certain amendments need ratification by at least half of the State legislatures.</li> <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: This blend allows the Constitution to be a living document, capable of evolving with changing circumstances while maintaining its core principles.</li> </ul> <h3>3. Federal System with Unitary Bias</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Division of Powers</strong>: India has a federal system of government with a clear division of powers between the Union and the States, outlined in the Seventh Schedule, which includes the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.</li> <li><strong>Unitary Features</strong>: Despite being federal in nature, the Indian Constitution exhibits a unitary bias in times of emergency, where the central government can assume greater control over the states.</li> </ul> <h3>4. Parliamentary Form of Government</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Democratic Framework</strong>: The Indian Constitution adopts a parliamentary system of government, modeled after the British system, where the executive is accountable to the legislature.</li> <li><strong>Collective Responsibility</strong>: The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.</li> </ul> <h3>5. Fundamental Rights</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Guarantee of Civil Liberties</strong>: Part III of the Constitution enumerates Fundamental Rights, which are justiciable and enforceable by the courts.</li> <li><strong>Types of Rights</strong>: These include the Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right against Exploitation, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, and the Right to Constitutional Remedies.</li> </ul> <h3>6. Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs)</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Guiding Principles</strong>: Part IV of the Constitution contains the Directive Principles of State Policy, which are non-justiciable guidelines for the state to follow in governance.</li> <li><strong>Social Welfare Goals</strong>: DPSPs promote ideals such as the provision of adequate livelihood, equal pay for equal work, the right to work, education, and public assistance, and the protection of the environment.</li> </ul> <h3>7. Fundamental Duties</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Citizen’s Responsibilities</strong>: The Fundamental Duties, added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, are outlined in Part IVA of the Constitution.</li> <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Duties include respecting the national symbols, safeguarding public property, promoting harmony, and preserving the rich heritage and environment of the country.</li> </ul> <h3>8. Secular State</h3> <ul> <li><strong>No State Religion</strong>: The Indian Constitution declares India as a secular state, meaning that the state does not favor any religion and provides equal treatment to all religions.</li> <li><strong>Freedom of Conscience</strong>: The government does not interfere in religious matters, ensuring freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice, and propagate any religion.</li> </ul> <h3>9. Independent Judiciary</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Guardian of the Constitution</strong>: The judiciary in India is independent and acts as the guardian and interpreter of the Constitution.</li> <li><strong>Judicial Review</strong>: The power of judicial review allows the courts to declare any law or executive action unconstitutional if it violates the provisions of the Constitution.</li> </ul><h3>10. Single Citizenship</h3> <ul> <li><strong>National Unity</strong>: Unlike many federal countries, India provides for single citizenship. Every citizen, irrespective of the state of their domicile, is recognized as a citizen of India, which promotes national unity and integrity.</li> </ul> <h3>11. Universal Adult Franchise</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Democratic Participation</strong>: The Constitution grants universal adult suffrage, allowing every citizen above the age of 18, regardless of gender, caste, religion, or wealth, to vote in elections.</li> </ul> <h3>12. Emergency Provisions</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Safeguard Mechanisms</strong>: The Constitution includes provisions to deal with emergencies that threaten the security and integrity of the country.</li> <li><strong>Types of Emergencies</strong>: These are classified as National Emergency, State Emergency (President's Rule), and Financial Emergency.</li> <li><strong>Centralized Control</strong>: During emergencies, the federal structure can be altered, with significant powers shifting to the central government.</li> </ul> <h3>13. Special Provisions for Certain States</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Asymmetrical Federalism</strong>: The Constitution makes special provisions for certain states with unique circumstances, such as Jammu and Kashmir (Article 370, now abrogated), and special provisions for the northeastern states (Article 371).</li> </ul> <h3>14.

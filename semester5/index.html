          </ul>
        </ol></ans> <br>

        <mark><que>11. When we use Classical model?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>The Classical Model (also known as the Waterfall Model) in software development is used when: <br>
          <li>Clear and Stable Requirements: The project requirements are well-understood, clearly defined, and unlikely to change over time.</li>
          <li>Linear Process: The project can be completed in a linear, sequential manner, where each phase depends on the completion of the previous one (e.g., requirements → design → implementation → testing → maintenance).</li>
          <li>Small or Medium-sized Projects: The project is relatively simple and small to medium in size, making a structured approach more feasible.</li>
          <li>No Immediate Feedback Needed: Since feedback loops are minimal or absent between phases, it works well when the client or stakeholders do not need to see regular progress updates or changes</li>
          <li>Low Complexity and Risks: The project has low technical complexity and minimal risk of unexpected changes or complications.</li>
          <li>Well-documented Development Process: Emphasis is placed on comprehensive documentation at each stage, making it suitable for environments that require clear audit trails.</li>
        </ans> <br>


        <mark><que>12.Describe Interactive Waterfall Model ?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>The Iterative Waterfall Model is a software development approach that combines the sequential steps of the traditional Waterfall Model with the flexibility of iterative design. It allows for improvements and changes to be made at each stage of the development process, instead of waiting until the end of the project. The iterative waterfall model provides feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases, which is the main difference from the classical waterfall model. <br> The Interactive Waterfall Model is a variation of the traditional Waterfall model where feedback and iterations are introduced between phases. In this model, instead of moving strictly in a linear, one-way process, some steps allow revisiting previous phases to refine or adjust work based on feedback or evolving understanding, while still maintaining the general sequential structure of the Waterfall approach.</ans> <br><br>


        <mark><que>13. Describe  evolutionary  model?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>This evolutionary model concept comes into the picture after the user faces the partially developed system rather than waiting for the fully developed version. The idea of this evolutionary model comes from developing the core module and then improving the software product by using iterative and incremental techniques with appropriate feedback.

          In this evolutionary process model, the software product is in the sensitive version, which is made through many iterations, and then the final product is prepared. This evolutionary approach also suggests breaking down all the models into maintainable smaller chunks. After that, we can prioritize all the smaller products. After completing all the products, we can deliver those chunks one at a time to the users.
          
          It plays a vital role in large projects where we can easily search the module for the implementation of incremental things. It is also an influential model because it collects customer feedback throughout the development process, and the customer can use the base feature of the project before the release of the entire working version.</ans> <br><br>


          <mark><que>14. When we use the SDLC model?</que><br></mark>
          <ans>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is used when there is a need for a structured, organized, and methodical approach to software development. It provides a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The SDLC model is typically employed in situations where a project requires clear stages and defined processes to ensure quality, consistency, and alignment with business objectives.

            Organizations use the SDLC model to manage complex software projects, as it helps break down the development process into distinct phases: requirements gathering, system design, implementation (coding), testing, deployment, and maintenance. This structured approach ensures that each phase is carefully planned and executed, reducing risks, avoiding missed requirements, and improving the quality of the final product.
            
            The SDLC model is particularly useful in projects where it's critical to have formalized processes, thorough documentation, and a predictable development timeline. It helps project managers, developers, and stakeholders understand the scope of the project, anticipate challenges, and manage resources efficiently.
            
            In highly regulated industries or large enterprise environments, the SDLC model provides the necessary framework for complying with regulatory requirements, maintaining audit trails, and ensuring that the software meets stringent quality standards.
            
            The model is used when there is a clear understanding of the project requirements from the beginning. It works well for projects with well-defined objectives and stable requirements, minimizing the need for major changes later in the development process. Even when changes are required, the SDLC model accommodates them through maintenance and continuous improvement phases.
            
            In summary, the SDLC model is used when a well-organized, structured, and predictable approach to software development is required, making it an essential framework for managing large-scale, complex software projects that demand reliability, precision, and consistency.</ans> <br> <br>

<h3>Software as a Product: An Imagination</h3>

<p>Imagine software as a product, similar to any physical product you might buy, like a car or a smartphone. Here’s how we can break it down:</p>

<h4>1. Design and Blueprint</h4>
<p>
  Just as a physical product starts with a design or blueprint, software begins with planning and requirements gathering. Software engineers draft the system architecture, user interface (UI) designs, and functionality plans. This is akin to creating a detailed product sketch before manufacturing begins.
</p>

<h4>2. Development (Manufacturing)</h4>
<p>
  In manufacturing a physical product, raw materials are used to build the final product. In software, this step is the coding phase where programmers "build" the product by writing code, creating features, and testing to ensure quality.
</p>

<h4>3. Testing (Quality Control)</h4>
<p>
  Just like a physical product undergoes quality control tests to ensure it works as intended, software must go through rigorous testing phases (unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests) to ensure it functions properly, is secure, and meets the original specifications.
</p>

<h4>4. Distribution and Deployment</h4>
<p>
  Once a physical product is ready, it gets packaged and shipped to stores for customers to purchase. Similarly, once software is completed, it is deployed or distributed, either through downloads, app stores, or cloud services, so that end-users can access and use it.

<h4>5. Maintenance and Updates</h4>
<p>
  Physical products might get recalled or updated (e.g., a car might need a software update or a replacement part). Similarly, software needs to be updated regularly to fix bugs, introduce new features, or improve performance. Continuous maintenance is key to a product's longevity.
</p>

<h4>6. Customer Feedback and Improvements</h4>
<p>
  Just like companies gather feedback from customers to improve physical products, software developers collect user feedback, reviews, and crash reports to make future improvements, ensuring that the software stays relevant and user-friendly.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Software as a product goes through a life cycle similar to any manufactured good. It requires careful design, development, testing, distribution, and ongoing maintenance to ensure it remains functional, reliable, and competitive in the market.
</p>
<h3>What is a Module?</h3>
<p>
  A <strong>module</strong> is a self-contained unit of software that encapsulates a specific functionality or a set of related functionalities. It represents a segment of a larger system, designed to handle a particular task or feature independently. Each module typically interacts with other modules to form a complete system, but it operates independently with its own code and data.
</p>

<p>
  For example, in a web application, you might have separate modules for user authentication, data management, and reporting. Each module handles its own responsibilities without affecting others directly.
</p>

<h4>Key Characteristics of a Module:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Each module contains all the necessary code to perform its task.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Modules can be reused in different parts of the system or in other projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Independence:</strong> A module works independently and has a specific role.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Modules help separate different functionalities in a project, making the system easier to manage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Modularization?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Modularization</strong> is the process of breaking down a large, complex system into smaller, more manageable parts or modules. It is a software design technique that promotes separation of concerns by organizing code into distinct, self-contained modules.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of modularization is to improve the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the software. By dividing a project into independent modules, developers can focus on individual components, making it easier to identify bugs, add new features, and scale the system.
</p>

<h4>Advantages of Modularization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Maintainability:</strong> It’s easier to maintain and update a smaller module than a large system.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.</li>
  <li><strong>Better Reusability:</strong> Modular components can be reused across different projects or parts of the same project.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Systems that are modularized are easier to scale and expand by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Bugs are easier to locate and fix within a module rather than in a monolithic system.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  In summary, a <strong>module</strong> is a standalone component in a software system, while <strong>modularization</strong> is the practice of dividing a system into these independent modules. This approach leads to better code organization, improved maintainability, and scalability of the software.
</p>
<h3>What is Cohesion?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Cohesion</strong> refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a software module or class are. A module with high cohesion means that its components are highly related to each other and work together to perform a single, well-defined task.
</p>
<p>
  High cohesion is desirable because it makes a module easier to maintain, understand, and reuse. Modules that handle specific, related tasks tend to have fewer dependencies, making them less complex.
</p>

<h4>Types of Cohesion:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional Cohesion:</strong> The module performs exactly one task or operation, which is considered the best type of cohesion.</li>
  <li><strong>Sequential Cohesion:</strong> Elements of a module are grouped because the output of one is the input to another.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicational Cohesion:</strong> Elements operate on the same data or contribute to a single task.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedural Cohesion:</strong> Elements of a module are grouped because they always follow a specific sequence of execution.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporal Cohesion:</strong> Elements are grouped by timing or execution, such as initialization or cleanup functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Logical Cohesion:</strong> Elements perform related tasks but are logically grouped based on categories, such as error handling routines.</li>
  <li><strong>Coincidental Cohesion:</strong> Elements are grouped arbitrarily without any specific reason, which is considered the lowest and least desirable type of cohesion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Feasibility?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Feasibility</strong> refers to the evaluation process of determining whether a project or solution is practical, achievable, and viable in terms of cost, time, resources, and technology. Feasibility studies are typically performed at the start of a project to assess whether the proposed solution can be successfully implemented.
</p>

<h4>Types of Feasibility:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> Determines whether the technology and skills required to develop the solution are available and sufficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Economic Feasibility:</strong> Assesses whether the cost of developing the solution is justified by the benefits it will provide, also known as cost-benefit analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Feasibility:</strong> Evaluates whether the solution will function as intended in the existing environment and whether it will solve the intended problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Feasibility:</strong> Determines whether the proposed solution meets legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule Feasibility:</strong> Assesses whether the solution can be developed and implemented within the required time frame.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Coupling?</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Coupling</strong> refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. It measures how tightly or loosely connected different modules are in a system. Lower coupling is desirable because it allows modules to be changed or replaced without affecting other parts of the system.
</p>
<p>
  High coupling means that changes in one module will likely affect other modules, leading to increased complexity and reduced maintainability. Low coupling, on the other hand, promotes modularity and allows for easier system maintenance and flexibility.
</p>

<h4>Types of Coupling:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content Coupling:</strong> One module directly modifies or relies on the internal workings of another, which is the most undesirable type.</li>
  <li><strong>Common Coupling:</strong> Multiple modules share global data, which can lead to unexpected side effects and is generally discouraged.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Coupling:</strong> One module controls the flow of another by passing control information (e.g., flags or conditions).</li>
  <li><strong>Stamp Coupling:</strong> Modules share a composite data structure, but they only use a part of it, leading to unnecessary dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Coupling:</strong> Modules share only necessary data through parameters, which is the most desirable form of coupling.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  In summary, <strong>cohesion</strong> refers to how well elements within a module work together, <strong>feasibility</strong> assesses the practicality of a project in various dimensions, and <strong>coupling</strong> measures the level of dependency between modules. High cohesion and low coupling are desirable for creating modular, maintainable software systems.

<h4>Q2: How do security and compliance challenges differ across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?</h4>
<p>
A: Security and compliance challenges vary significantly across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, as the level of control and responsibility differs in each model.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Provides the most control but also the most responsibility for the user.</li>
      <li>Security responsibilities include managing virtual machines, networks, storage, operating systems, and the application environment.</li>
      <li>Compliance challenges arise from configuring and securing each layer, from the OS to the application.</li>
      <li>Users need to implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection, encryption, and access control on their virtualized environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Abstracts more layers of infrastructure management compared to IaaS, offering a managed platform for building and deploying applications.</li>
      <li>The cloud provider is responsible for securing the platform, runtime, and underlying infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Users are responsible for application security, managing access control, and ensuring that the code they deploy is secure.</li>
      <li>Compliance focuses on application-level governance, encryption, and user data protection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>The cloud provider handles the full stack, including infrastructure, platform, and application.</li>
      <li>Security responsibilities are primarily on the provider, but the user must still ensure proper governance of their data and control who has access to it.</li>
      <li>Compliance is often easier for users, as SaaS providers usually offer certifications like GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, but users must configure their usage correctly to ensure compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Q3: What are the responsibility models in cloud security, and how do they apply to different cloud models?</h4>

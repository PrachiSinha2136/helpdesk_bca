      Term Entrepreneur is defined as the person who bears uncertainty and risk. 
      (Richard Cantiilan, French banker)

(B. Higgins)
      <br><br>
      Entrepreneurship involves the willingness to assume risks in undertaking an economic activity, particularly a new one. It may involve an innovation but not necessarily so.

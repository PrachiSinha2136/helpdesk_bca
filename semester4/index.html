            It is the part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete (distinct or unconnected) object.<br>
            Here are some problem solved using discrete mathematics-<br>
            <ol>
              <li>How many ways are there to choose a valid password on a computer system.</li>
              <li>How can I identify spam email messages.</li>
              <li>How can I encrypt a message so that no unintended recipient can read it?</li>
              <li>How can it will prove that a sorting algorithm correctly sort a list.</li>
              <li>How many valid internet address are there.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4><b><u><li>Application of Discrete Mathematics -</li></u></b></h4>
            It provides mathematical foundation for many computer science course including data structures, algoric, 
            database theory, autometa theory, formal language compiler theory, computer security and operating system.
   <h4><b><u><li>Venn-Diagram</li></u></b></h4>
           A Venn-Diagram is a pictorial representation of sets in which sets are represented by inclose areas in the plane.

The substitution method is also called as iterative method which is used for finding formula for recurrence relation. Solving the recurrence relation by iteration means finding an explicit formula for f(n). This is done in two steps:<br>

         H<sub>1</sub> = 1(0)/2 = 0<br>
         which agrees with initial condition. Hence formula is true for n=1. <br>
         Induction step: Let us assume that the formula is true for n=k,<br>

         H<sub>k+1</sub> = {k<sup>2</sup>-k+2k}/2<br>
         H<sub>k+1</sub> = {k<sup>2</sup>+k}/2<br>
         H<sub>k+1</sub> = {k(k+1)}/2 <br>

        <li><b>Growth of Functions -</b></li>
        Given functions f and g, we wish to show how to quantify the statement:<br>
          <center>“g grows as fast as f”.</center>
        The growth of functions is directly related to the complexity of algorithms. We
        are guided by the following principles.<br>
        • We only care about the behavior for “large” problems.<br>
        • We may ignore implementation details such as loop counter incrementation.<br><br> 
  
        The growth of function is often described using special notation such as big-O, big-Omega, and big-Theta.<br>
  
        <li><b>Big-O Notation -</b></li>
        Let f and g be functions from the set of integers or the set of real numbers to the set of real
        numbers. We say that f (x) is O(g(x)) if there are constants C and k such that<br>
          <center>|f (x)| ≤ C|g(x)|  </center>
        whenever x>k. <br>
        The constants C and k in the definition of big-O notation are called witnesses to the
        relationship f (x) is O(g(x)).<br><br>
        <b><li>Application-</li></b>
        One of the advantages of using big-O notation is that we can estimate the growth of a function without worrying
        about constant multipliers or smaller order terms. This means that using big-O notation we do not have to worry about the hardware and software used to implement an algorithm.<br>
        Futhermore, using big-O notation we can assume that the differnt operation used in an algorithm take the same time which simplifies the analysis considerably. Big-O notation is used extensively to estimate the number of operation and algorithm uses as its input growth.<br><br>

              To show that n<sup>2</sup> is n ot O(n), we must show that no pair of witnesses C and k exist
              such that n<sup>2</sup> ≤ Cn whenever n>k. For this when n > 0 we can divide both sides of the inequality n<sup>2</sup> ≤ Cn by n we get
               n ≤ C. However, no matter what C and k are, the inequality n ≤ C cannot hold for
              all n with n>k. In particular, once we set a value of k, we see that when n is larger than the
              maximum of k and C, it is not true that n ≤ C even though n>k.

          i.e. the sum of the degree of the vertices is even.
  <br>
          <b>Proof-</b><br>
          Since, the degree of vertex if the number of edges incident with that vertex the sum of the degree counts the total number of times and edge is incident with a vertex.<br>
          Since, every edge is incident with exactly two vertex, each edge gets counted twice once at each end.<br>
          Thus, sum of degree equal twice the number of edges.

<h1><b>Introduction:</h1></b><br>
<p><b>C++</b> is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming 
language with additional features. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s, with the 
first edition of "The C++ Programming Language" published in 1985. C++ is often referred to as a "middle-
level" programming language because it combines low-level features for efficient hardware manipulation with 
high-level features for better program organization and development productivity.
<br>
C++ is different from other high-level languages such as FORTRAN, Pascal, BASIC, C and COBOL, because 
object-oriented programming combines both data and the associated functions into a single unit called a class, 
whereas in other high-level languages the programs execute a sequence of instructions or procedures. Bjarne 
Stroustrup of AT&T Laboratories is the architect of the C++ language, which was first known as 'C with
classes'. The name C++ (pronounced as C plus plus) was coined by Rick Mascitti in 1983. The class concept 
was derived from Simula 67.</p><br>


<h2><b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</b></h2><br>
<p>The principle of object-oriented programming is to combine both data and the associated functions into a single 
unit called a class. An object in programming means data. Data is therefore predominant in object-oriented 
programming. The concept will become clear with examples. However, in the object-oriented paradigm, 
accessibility of data is restricted and therefore, accidental corruption of data is minimized or eliminated. Thus, 
OOP ensures integrity of data. <br>
C++ supports object-oriented programming, a paradigm that organizes code into objects representing real-world 
entities. This includes concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
 <h3><b>Features of OOPS:</h3></b>

<p>The fundamental features of OOPS are as follows: -</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>ENCAPSULATION:-</b>
It is mechanisms that associate the code and data it manipulates into a single unit and it keeps them 
safe from interference and misuse. In C++, this is supported by construct called class. An instance of a 
class is known as object, which represents a real-world entity.</li>

<li><b>DATA ABSTRACTION:</b> -
The technique of creating new data type that is well suited to an application to be programmed is known 
as data abstraction. It provides the ability to create user defined data types, for modeling a real-world 
object having the properties of built in data types and a set of permitted operators. The class is a construct 
in C++ for creating user-defined data types called abstract data types (ADT).</li>

<li><b>INHERITANCE: -</b>
It allows the extension and reuse of existing code without having to rewrite the code from scratch. 
Inheritance involves the creation of new classes (derived classes) from the existing one (base classes), thus 
enabling the creation of hierarchy of classes. It simulates the class and subclass concept of the real world. 
The new derived class inherits the members of the base class and also adds its own.</li>

<p>Two popular forms of inheritance are single and multiple inheritances.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single inheritance:</b> refers to deriving a class from a single base class is supported by C++.</li>
<li><b>Multiple inheritance:</b> The mechanism by which a class is derived from more than one base 
class is known as multiple inheritance. Instances of classes with multiple inheritance have 
instance variables for each of the inheritance base classes. C++ supports multiple inheritance.</li></ul>

<li><b>POLYMORPHISM: -</b>
It allows a single name /operator to be associated with different operation depending on the type of data 
passed to it. In C++, it achieved by function overloading and dynamic binding (virtual function).</li>

<li><b>EXTENSIBILITY: - </b>It is a feature, which allows the extension of the functionality of the existing 
software components. In C++, this is achieved through abstract classes and inheritance.</li></ol>

<h4><b>Application of C++ :</h4></b>
<p>C++ is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications. Here are some common areas
where C++ is frequently used:</p>
<Ol type ="1">
<li><b>System/Kernel Development: </b>C++ is often used for developing operating systems and system-level 
software due to its low-level features and direct hardware manipulation capabilities.</li>
<li><b>Game Development:</b> Many game engines and large-scale video games are built using C++ due to its 
high performance and ability to manage system resources efficiently.</li>
<li><b>Embedded Systems:</b> C++ is used in embedded systems programming where direct hardware 
manipulation is required. Its efficiency and low-level features make it suitable for resource-constrained 
environments.</li>
<li><b>Desktop Applications:</b> Applications like Adobe products, Microsoft Office, and various other desktop 
applications are developed using C++ for performance reasons.</li>
<li><b>Databases</b>: C++ is employed in the development of database management systems and database 
engines. For example, MySQL, one of the popular relational database management systems, uses C++.</li>
<li><b>Web Browsers:</b> Components of web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, are 
implemented in C++ for performance and efficiency.</li>
<li><b>Compilers:</b> C++ is used in the development of compilers for various programming languages. GCC 
(GNU Compiler Collection) is an example of a compiler that is implemented in C++. </li>
<li><b>Networking:</b> Networking applications and protocols are often implemented using C++. Networking 
libraries like Boost.Asio facilitate the development of networked applications.</li>
<li><b>Graphics and GUI Applications:</b> C++ is commonly used for developing graphics-intensive applications, 
computer-aided design (CAD) software, and graphical user interface (GUI) applications.</li>
<li><b>Financial Software: </b>In the finance sector, C++ is widely used for developing applications related to 
algorithmic trading, risk management, and other financial software due to its high performance.</li>
<li><b>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:</b> C++ is sometimes used in AI and machine learning 
projects, particularly for performance-critical components. Libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV have 
c++ APIs. Etc.</li></Ol>
